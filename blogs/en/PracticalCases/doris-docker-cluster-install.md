    "description": "Apache Doris is a very hot and popular MPP architecture OLAP database, many students want to learn/test the use and ability of Doris, but suffer from the lack of environment or fear of the long compilation + build process, the whole process has greatly discouraged many students who are willing to try, but due to a variety of objective factors can not afford the high cost of learning, resulting in failed attempts. Therefore, three community members of Apache Doris community, Yijia Su, Yi Zhu and Chundong Yang, created three different designs of installation and provided downloads to lower the learning threshold and improve the learning/testing efficiency.",
