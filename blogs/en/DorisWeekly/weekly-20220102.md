## Main progress

### New features

* https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7276

    Support return binary data of HLL/BITMAP column directly for external parsing.
    
* https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7255

    Support for Lateral View column to row transitions. It is convenient to expand bitmap, stirng or json array data into multiple rows for subsequent processing.
    
* https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7379

    `bitmap_union` and `bitmap_intersect` support multiple bitmap arguments. This is to improve the efficiency of intersecting and merging multiple bitmaps.
    
* https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7464

    Support SM3/SM4 national secret algorithm functions.
    
### Work-in-Progess

* https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7098

    Support cold data dumping to object storage (under development).
